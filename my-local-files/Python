What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
-------------------
It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.
------------------------
What can Python do?

Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
--------------------------
Why Python?

Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
-----------------------------
Python Veriable: 

let's consider the veriable is something like a box, you can store anything in it, ( store something like info, value, data, whatever ) it eases the management of big data and values in python language.
------------------------------
A variable is a container for a value. It can be assigned a name, you can use it to refer to it later in the program.
Based on the value assigned, the interpreter decides its data type. You can always store a different type in a variable.
For example, if you store 7 in a variable, later, you can store ‘Dinosaur’.
-------------------------------
Python Data Types

1. Python Numbers:

There are four numeric Python data types.
a. int
int stands for integer. This Python Data Type holds signed integers. We can use the type() function to find which class it belongs to.

b. float
This Python Data Type holds floating-point real values. An int can only store the number 3, but float can store 3.25 if you want.

c. long
This Python Data type holds a long integer of unlimited length. But this construct does not exist in Python 3.x.

d. complex
This Python Data type holds a complex number. A complex number looks like this: a+bj Here, a and b are the real parts of the number, and j is imaginary.
---------------------------------
2. Strings:

A string is a sequence of characters. Python does not have a char data type, unlike C++ or Java. You can delimit a string using single quotes or double-quotes.
---------------------------------
3. Python Lists:

A list is a collection of values. Remember, it may contain different types of values.
To define a list, you must put values separated with commas in square brackets. You don’t need to declare a type for a list either.
---------------------------------
4. Python Tuples:

A tuple is like a list. You declare it using parentheses instead

A string is a sequence of characters. Python does not have a char data type, unlike C++ or Java. You can delimit a string using single quotes or double-quotes.
-------------------------------
5. Dictionaries:

A dictionary holds key-value pairs. Declare it in curly braces, with pairs separated by commas. Separate keys and values by a colon(:).
------------------------------
-Constants: it's a type of veriable can't be changed in General.
-it's like a contianer that hold info or data which can't be changed letter
- declired and assigned in a sperate file to be readable
-------------------------------
- Numeric Literals:
 integer literals: Binary, Decimal, Octal, Hexadecimal
Numeric literals are unchangeable
int, float and complex
int, float and
-------------------------------
String Literals
-----------------------------
Boolean Literals:
--------------------------
Special Literals: none
Define a null value
-------------------
Lists: 
ordered sequence
most popular and used data type
flexible
store many types of data
